# ChatApp

This app was inspired to allow users to be able to talk to each other, each user has to signup and then login, they will then be directed to home page where they can send 
and recieve messages to each other, the database used for this was phpmyadmin and the coding languages were HTML,CSS,PHP AND SQL
